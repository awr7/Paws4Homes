## Introduction

Welcome to Paws4Homes, a web application designed to address the challenges of stray dogs, unnecessary euthanasia, and overbreeding that escalated during the 2020 pandemic. During this period, the demand for pet companionship soared as people sought comfort and connection while confined to their homes. This led to a significant increase in dog adoptions and purchases. However, as the world started to recover and return to normalcy, many individuals realized they could no longer sustain the commitment of pet ownership due to changing lifestyles and reduced time at home. This resulted in a surge of strays, overcrowded shelters, unnecessary euthanasia, and overbreeding challenges. Paws4Homes is designed to alleviate these issues by connecting shelters, breeders, and potential pet owners, thereby ensuring the well-being and proper care of dogs.
